Bringing Personal Finance into the 1980s

Elon Musk has come to you and is asking for help. He's decided to give up on the Hyperloop and SpaceX to focus on building what he thinks will be the next big thing... Personal Finance.

Personal Finance is a revolutionary new way to manage your expenses from the command line.

Features

Users should be able to enter their transactions (which have an payee, an amount, a date, and a category). They can see a list of all transactions, edit / delete transactions, and see their current balance.

Users should be able to look at transactions by category (i.e. filtering), and see the total 'cost' of transactions in that category.

Requirements

All features listed above
Transactions should support debits and credits (+ and - values)
The user should be able to quit the command line not lose their transactions.
Bonus

Allow filtering by date
Support tracking multiple accounts (i.e. checking / savings), which have many transactions (a given transaction only belongs to one account)
Other ideas you think would be useful!
